# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-XOR-Problem
 This code implements a neural network from scratch in Python to solve the XOR problem. The network consists of one hidden layer with a configurable number of neurons and uses the sigmoid activation function. The backpropagation algorithm is employed for training, and the mean squared error (MSE) is used as the loss function.
